## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Instant Bell Access (Priority: P1)

User wants immediate access to bell sound functionality through a modern React Native interface styled with Tailwind CSS that communicates with Rust backend for optimal performance.

**Why this priority**: Core MVP functionality - React Native frontend with Tailwind CSS provides beautiful, responsive UI while Rust backend ensures fast, reliable audio processing.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by installing the app, tapping the bell button, and confirming audio plays through Rust audio service with <100ms latency while UI responds smoothly with Tailwind animations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has installed the React Native app, **When** they launch it, **Then** the Tailwind-styled interface loads within 2 seconds per constitution requirements
2. **Given** the app is open, **When** user taps the Tailwind-styled bell button, **Then** React Native sends request to Rust backend, audio plays within 100ms, and button shows smooth Tailwind animation feedback
3. **Given** the Rust backend service is running, **When** multiple bell requests come in, **Then** all are processed without performance degradation while Tailwind UI remains responsive

### User Story 2 - High-Performance Background Operation (Priority: P1)

User requires background notifications that leverage Rust's performance advantages for minimal battery usage while maintaining React Native's mobile compatibility.

**Why this priority**: Critical for utility - Rust backend handles efficient background processing while React Native manages mobile lifecycle and permissions.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by running background bell notifications for 24 hours and measuring <1% battery consumption per constitution.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app is in background, **When** scheduled bell triggers, **Then** Rust service processes and plays audio without waking React Native frontend unnecessarily
2. **Given** phone is locked, **When** background bell occurs, **Then** Rust backend handles audio while using <5MB memory overhead
3. **Given** multiple background notifications, **When** they trigger within short intervals, **Then** Rust service manages queue without performance impact

---

### User Story 3 - Cross-Platform Resource Efficiency (Priority: P1)

User needs the app to maintain React Native's cross-platform compatibility while leveraging Rust's performance for resource optimization across all Android devices.

**Why this priority**: Essential requirement - React Native ensures device compatibility while Rust guarantees performance standards are met.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested across different Android versions and manufacturers to confirm consistent <50MB memory usage and <1% battery consumption.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app runs on any Android 6.0+ device, **When** monitoring resource usage, **Then** memory consumption stays below 50MB per constitution
2. **Given** 24 hours of normal usage, **When** battery consumption is measured, **Then** it remains under 1% of total battery usage
3. **Given** app is idle for 1 hour, **When** resource state is checked, **Then** both React Native and Rust components enter deep sleep modes

---

### User Story 4 - Expo Development Workflow (Priority: P2)

Developer needs rapid iteration capability through Expo while maintaining the React Native + Rust architecture for production performance.

**Why this priority**: Enables fast development cycles with Expo while preserving Rust's performance benefits in production builds.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by successfully testing changes through Expo QR code and confirming equivalent performance in production builds.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** Expo development server is running, **When** developer scans QR code, **Then** React Native app launches with Rust backend connection established
2. **Given** code changes are made to React Native components, **When** QR is scanned again, **Then** updates load without Rust backend restart
3. **Given** Rust backend code changes, **When** app is tested, **Then** performance improvements are measurable in both development and production

---

### User Story 5 - Modern UI/UX with Tailwind CSS (Priority: P2)

User wants a visually appealing, modern interface that uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design, smooth animations, and professional appearance across all Android devices.

**Why this priority**: Essential for user adoption and satisfaction - modern, attractive UI improves perceived quality and usability while maintaining performance standards.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by testing UI responsiveness, animations, and visual consistency across different screen sizes and Android versions.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** app uses Tailwind CSS via NativeWind, **When** displayed on different screen sizes, **Then** layout remains responsive and visually balanced
2. **Given** user interacts with bell button, **When** tapped, **Then** smooth Tailwind animations provide immediate visual feedback
3. **Given** app runs on various Android devices, **When** UI renders, **Then** Tailwind styling maintains consistent appearance and performance

---

### User Story 6 - User Preference Management (Priority: P2)

User wants flexible control over silent/vibrate mode behavior through an intuitive React Native settings interface, with Rust backend executing their preferences precisely.

**Why this priority**: Provides maximum flexibility and user control - React Native UI offers intuitive settings while Rust backend ensures reliable execution of user choices.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified by testing different preference settings and confirming Rust backend responds correctly to each configuration.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens React Native settings screen, **When** they select silent mode behavior, **Then** Tailwind-styled options include: respect system, always play, custom schedule
2. **Given** user selects "always play" option, **When** device is in silent mode, **Then** Rust backend plays bell audio regardless of system setting
3. **Given** user selects "respect system" option, **When** device is in silent mode, **Then** Rust backend follows system silent mode and does not play
4. **Given** user changes preference settings, **When** settings are saved, **Then** Rust backend immediately applies new behavior to subsequent notifications

---

### User Story 7 - Type Safety and Reliability (Priority: P2)

User requires a reliable app that benefits from TypeScript's type safety in React Native and Rust's memory safety guarantees.

**Why this priority**: Ensures robust, maintainable codebase that prevents common runtime errors through strong typing.

**Independent Test**: Can be verified through comprehensive test coverage and absence of type-related runtime errors.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** React Native frontend with TypeScript, **When** components interact, **Then** all data flows are type-checked at compile time
2. **Given** Rust backend processes requests, **When** audio operations occur, **Then** memory safety is guaranteed without runtime overhead
3. **Given** communication between frontend and backend, **When** data is exchanged, **Then** serialization maintains type safety across the boundary

### Edge Cases

- What happens when Rust backend service crashes during audio playback?
- How does system handle React Native app lifecycle during active bell operations?
- What occurs when device enters deep sleep while Rust backend is processing?
- How does app behave when network connectivity affects backend communication?
- What happens when memory constraints force Rust service optimization?
